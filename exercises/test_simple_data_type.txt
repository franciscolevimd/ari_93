This is a doctest based regression suite for simple_data_type.py
Each '>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.


>>> from simple_data_type import calculate_payment,sum_numbers


>>> calculate_payment(34.27, 8)
274.16


>>> sum_numbers(13)
91
