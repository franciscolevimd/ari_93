This is a doctest based regression suite for random_challenges.py
Each '>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.


>>> from random_challenges import is_palindorme, sort_only_natural_numbers


>>> is_palindorme('Reconocer')
True


>>> is_palindorme('Tania')
False


>>> sort_only_natural_numbers([6, 5, 4, -1, 3, 2, -1, 1])
[1, 2, 3, -1, 4, 5, -1, 6]

>>> sort_only_natural_numbers([])
[]

>>> sort_only_natural_numbers(None)
