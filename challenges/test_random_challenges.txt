This is a doctest based regression suite for random_challenges.py
Each '>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.


>>> from random_challenges import is_palindorme


>>> is_palindorme('Reconocer')
True


>>> is_palindorme('Tania')
False
