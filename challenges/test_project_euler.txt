This is a doctest based regression suite for project_euler.py
Each '>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.


>>> from project_euler import sum_multiples_3_5


>>> sum_multiples_3_5(1000)
