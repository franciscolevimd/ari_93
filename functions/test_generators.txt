This is a doctest based regression suite for generators.py
Each '>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.


>>> from generators import natural_numbers, draw_triangle


>>> for number in natural_numbers():

>>> for pixel in draw_triangle():
... 	print(pixel)
... 	break
