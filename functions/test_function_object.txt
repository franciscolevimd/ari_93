This is a doctest based regression suite for function_object.py
Each '>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.


>>> from function_object import average, max


>>> average(1, 2, 3, 4)
2.5


>>> max(b=-6, w=38, f=6)
'w'
